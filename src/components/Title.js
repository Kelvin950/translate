        A straightforward and quick program that makes that YouTube playlist,
        You are unable to play every time your phone goes to sleep, you switch
        to Instagram to follow your crush, or you go to Twitter to retweet
        something. You also save time by not having to manually add songs and
        make the playlist. Why don't you try this instead since nobody wants to
        pay for YouTube Premium?
